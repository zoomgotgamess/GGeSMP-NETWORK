      Air: |-
        Air is the element of freedom. Airbenders are natural pacifists and great explorers. There is nothing stopping them from scaling the tallest of mountains and walls easily. They specialize in redirection, from blasting things away with gusts of winds, to forming a shield around them to prevent damage. Easy to get across flat terrains, such as oceans, there is practically no terrain off limits to Airbenders. They lack much raw damage output, but make up for it with with their ridiculous amounts of utility and speed.
        Airbenders can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help AirCombos for more information.
      Water: |-
        Water is the element of change. Waterbending focuses on using your opponents own force against them. Using redirection and various dodging tactics, you can be made practically untouchable by an opponent. Waterbending provides agility, along with strong offensive skills while in or near water.
        Waterbenders can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help WaterCombos for more information.
      Earth: Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders share many of the same fundamental techniques as Waterbenders, but their domain is quite different and more readily accessible. Earthbenders dominate the ground and subterranean, having abilities to pull columns of rock straight up from the earth or drill their way through the mountain. They can also launch themselves through the air using pillars of rock, and will not hurt themselves assuming they land on something they can bend. The more skilled Earthbenders can even bend metal.
      Fire: |-
        Fire is the element of power. Firebenders focus on destruction and incineration. Their abilities are pretty straight forward: set things on fire. They do have a bit of utility however, being able to make themselves un-ignitable, extinguish large areas, cook food in their hands, extinguish large areas, small bursts of flight, and then comes the abilities to shoot fire from your hands.
        Firebenders can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help FireCombos for more information.
      Chi: |-
        Chiblockers focus on bare handed combat, utilizing their agility and speed to stop any bender right in their path. Although they lack the ability to bend any of the other elements, they are great in combat, and a serious threat to any bender. Chiblocking was first shown to be used by Ty Lee in Avatar: The Last Airbender, then later by members of the Equalists in The Legend of Korra.
        Chiblockers can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help ChiCombos for more information.

  Air:
    AirBlast:
      Description: AirBlast is the most fundamental bending technique of an airbender. To use, simply left-click in a direction. A gust of wind will be created at your fingertips, launching anything in its path harmlessly back. A gust of air can extinguish fires on the ground or on a player, can cool lava, and can flip levers and activate buttons. Additionally, tapping sneak will change the origin of your next AirBlast to your targeted location.

    AirBubble:
      Description: To use, the bender must hold down sneak. All water around the user in a small bubble will vanish, replacing itself once the user either gets too far away or selects a different ability.
    AirBurst:
      Description: AirBurst is one of the most powerful abilities in the airbender's arsenal. To use, press and hold sneak to charge your burst. Once charged, you can either release sneak to release the burst in a sphere around you or click to launch a cone-shaped burst of air in front of you. Additionally, having this ability selected when you land on the ground from a large enough fall will create a burst of air around you.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was thrown down by {attacker}''s {ability}'
      HorizontalVelocityDeath: '{victim} experienced kinetic damage by {attacker}''s
        {ability}'
    AirScooter:
      Description: AirScooter is a fast means of transportation. To use, sprint, jump then click with this ability selected. You will hop on a scooter of air and be propelled forward in the direction you're looking (you don't need to press anything). This ability can be used to levitate above liquids, but it cannot go up steep slopes. Any other actions will deactivate this ability.
    Tornado:
      Description: 'To use, simply sneak (default: shift). This will create a swirling
        vortex at the targeted location. Any creature or object caught in the vortex
        will be launched up and out in some random direction. If another player gets
        caught in the vortex, the launching effect is minimal. Tornado can also be
        used to transport the user. If the user gets caught in his/her own tornado,
        his movements are much more manageable. Provided the user doesn''t fall out
        of the vortex, it will take him to a maximum height and move him in the general
        direction he''s looking. Skilled airbenders can scale anything with this ability.'
    AirShield:
      Description: 'Air Shield is one of the most powerful defensive techniques in
        existence. To use, simply sneak (default: shift). This will create a whirlwind
        of air around the user, with a small pocket of safe space in the center. This
        wind will deflect all projectiles and will prevent any creature from entering
        it for as long as its maintained.'
    AirSpout:
      Description: This ability gives the airbender limited sustained levitation. It is a toggle - click to activate and form a whirling spout of air beneath you, lifting you up. You can bend other abilities while using AirSpout. Click again to deactivate this ability.
    AirSuction:
      Description: To use, simply left-click in a direction. A gust of wind will originate as far as it can in that direction and flow towards you, sucking anything in its path harmlessly with it. Skilled benders can use this technique to pull items from precarious locations. Additionally, tapping sneak will change the origin of your next AirSuction to your targeted location.
      HorizontalVelocityDeath: '{victim} experienced kinetic damage by {attacker}''s
        {ability}'
    AirSwipe:
      Description: To use, simply left-click in a direction. An arc of air will flow from you towards that direction, cutting and pushing back anything in its path. Its damage is minimal, but it still sends the message. This ability will extinguish fires, cool lava, and cut things like grass, mushrooms, and flowers. Additionally, you can charge it by holding sneak. Charging before attacking will increase damage and knockback, up to a maximum.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was struck by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    Flight:
      Description: 'Jump in the air, crouch (default: shift) and hold with this ability
        bound and you will glide around in the direction you look. While flying, click
        to Hover. Click again to disable Hovering.'
    Suffocate:
      Description: This ability is one of the most dangerous abilities an Airbender possesses. To use, simply look at an entity and hold shift. The entity will begin taking damage as you extract the air from their lungs. Any bender caught in this sphere will only be able to use basic moves, such as AirSwipe, WaterManipulation, FireBlast, or EarthBlast. An entity can be knocked out of the sphere by certain bending arts, and your attention will be disrupted if you are hit by bending.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was asphyxiated by {attacker}''s {ability}'

        Description: Control a large stream of air that grabs onto enemies allowing you to direct them temporarily.
      AirSweep:
        Description: Sweep the air in front of you hitting multiple enemies, causing moderate damage and a large knockback. The radius and direction of AirSweep is controlled by moving your mouse in a sweeping motion. For example, if you want to AirSweep upward, then move your mouse upward right after you left click AirBurst
        DeathMessage: '{victim} was swept away by {attacker}''s {ability}'

Bloodbent targets cannot move, bend or attack. You are free to control their actions by looking elsewhere - they will be forced to move in that direction. Additionally, clicking while bloodbending will launch that target off in the direction you're looking. People who are capable of bloodbending are immune to your technique, and you are immune to theirs.

      HorizontalVelocityDeath: '{victim} experienced kinetic damage by {attacker}''s
        {ability}'
    HealingWaters:
      Description: To use, the bender must be at least partially submerged in water. If the user is not sneaking, this ability will automatically begin working provided the user has it selected. If the user is sneaking, he/she is channeling the healing to their target in front of them. In order for this channel to be successful, the user and the target must be at least partially submerged in water.
    IceBlast:
      Description: 'This ability offers a powerful ice utility for Waterbenders. It
        can be used to fire an explosive burst of ice at an opponent, spraying ice
        and snow around it. To use, simply tap sneak (Default: Shift) while targeting
        a block of ice to select it as a source. From there, you can just left click
        to send the blast off at your opponent.'
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was shattered by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    IceSpike:
      Description: This ability has many functions. Clicking while targetting ice, or an entity over some ice, will raise a spike of ice up, damaging and slowing the target. Tapping sneak (shift) while selecting a water source will select that source that can then be fired with a click. Firing this will launch a spike of ice at your target, dealing a bit of damage and slowing the target. If you sneak (shift) while not selecting a source, many ice spikes will erupt from around you, damaging and slowing those targets.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was impaled by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    OctopusForm:
      Description: This ability allows the waterbender to manipulate a large quantity of water into a form resembling that of an octopus. To use, click to select a water source. Then, hold sneak to channel this ability. While channeling, the water will form itself around you and has a chance to block incoming attacks. Additionally, you can click while channeling to attack things near you, dealing damage and knocking them back. Releasing shift at any time will dissipate the form.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was slapped by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    PhaseChange:
      Description: 'To use, simply left-click. Any water you are looking at within
        range will instantly freeze over into solid ice. Provided you stay within
        range of the ice and do not unbind FreezeMelt, that ice will not thaw. If,
        however, you do either of those the ice will instantly thaw. If you sneak
        (default: shift), anything around where you are looking at will instantly
        melt. Since this is a more favorable state for these things, they will never
        re-freeze unless they would otherwise by nature or some other bending ability.
        Additionally, if you tap sneak while targetting water with FreezeMelt, it
        will evaporate water around that block that is above sea level. '
    PlantArmor:
      Description: PlantArmor is a defensive ability in the arsenal of the plantbender. Clicking on leaves with this ability will temporarily clad you in strong armor made out of plants! You can use this defensively, but you can also use the armor as a source for other plantbending skills.
    Surge:
      Description: This ability has two distinct features. If you sneak to select a source block, you can then click in a direction and a large wave will be launched in that direction. If you sneak again while the wave is en route, the wave will freeze the next target it hits. If, instead, you click to select a source block, you can hold sneak to form a wall of water at your cursor location. Click to shift between a water wall and an ice wall. Release sneak to dissipate it.
    Torrent:
      Description: Torrent is one of the strongest moves in a waterbender's arsenal. To use, first click a source block to select it; then hold shift to begin streaming the water around you. Water flowing around you this way will damage and knock back nearby enemies and projectiles. If you release shift during this, you will create a large wave that expands outwards from you, launching anything in its path back. Instead, if you click you release the water and channel it to flow towards your cursor. Anything caught in the blast will be tossed about violently and take damage. Finally, if you click again when the water is torrenting, it will freeze the area around it when it is obstructed.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was taken down by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    WaterArms:
      Description: |-
        One of the most diverse moves in a Waterbender's arsenal, this move creates tendrils of water from the players arms to emulate their actual arms. Each water arms mode will be binded to a slot, switch slots to change mode. To deactive the arms, hold Sneak and Double Left-Click.
        Pull - Use your Arms to pull blocks, items, mobs or even players towards you!
        Punch - An offensive attack, harming players or mobs!

    WaterManipulation:
      Description: 'To use, place your cursor over a waterbendable object and tap
        sneak (default: shift). Smoke will appear where you''ve selected, indicating
        the origin of your ability. After you have selected an origin, simply left-click
        in any direction and you will see your water spout off in that direction,
        slicing any creature in its path. If you look towards a creature when you
        use this ability, it will target that creature. A collision from Water Manipulation

        the source selected and tap shift again, you will be able to control the water
        more directly.'

        DeathMessage: '{victim} was frozen solid by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    Description: |-
      Water is the element of change. Waterbending focuses on using your opponents own force against them. Using redirection and various dodging tactics, you can be made practically untouchable by an opponent. Waterbending provides agility, along with strong offensive skills while in or near water.
      Waterbenders can chain their abilities into combos, type /b help WaterCombos for more information.
  Earth:
    Catapult:
      Description: To use, left-click while looking in the direction you want to be launched. A pillar of earth will jut up from under you and launch you in that direction - if and only if there is enough earth behind where you're looking to launch you. Skillful use of this ability takes much time and work, and it does result in the death of certain gung-ho earthbenders. If you plan to use this ability, be sure you've read about your passive ability you innately have as an earthbender.
    Collapse:
      Description: ' To use, simply left-click on an earthbendable block. That block
        and the earthbendable blocks above it will be shoved back into the earth below
        them, if they can. This ability does have the capacity to trap something inside
        of it, although it is incredibly difficult to do so. Additionally, press sneak
        with this ability to affect an area around your targetted location - all earth
        that can be moved downwards will be moved downwards. This ability is especially
        risky or deadly in caves, depending on the earthbender''s goal and technique.'
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was suffocated by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    EarthArmor:
      Description: This ability encases the earthbender in temporary armor. To use, click on a block that is earthbendable. If there is another block under it that is earthbendable, the block will fly to you and grant you temporary armor and damage reduction. This ability has a long cooldown.
    EarthBlast:
      Description: 'To use, place your cursor over an earthbendable object (dirt,
        rock, ores, etc) and tap sneak (default: shift). The object will temporarily
        turn to stone, indicating that you have it focused as the source for your
        ability. After you have selected an origin (you no longer need to be sneaking),
        simply left-click in any direction and you will see your object launch off
        in that direction, smashing into any creature in its path. If you look towards
        a creature when you use this ability, it will target that creature. A collision
        from Earth Blast both knocks the target back and deals some damage. You cannot
        have multiple of these abilities flying at the same time.'
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was broken apart by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    EarthGrab:
      Description: To use, simply left-click while targeting a creature within range. This ability will erect a circle of earth to trap the creature in.
    EarthTunnel:
      Description: 'Earth Tunnel is a completely utility ability for earthbenders.
        To use, simply sneak (default: shift) in the direction you want to tunnel.
        You will slowly begin tunneling in the direction you''re facing for as long
        as you sneak or if the tunnel has been dug long enough. This ability will
        be interrupted if it hits a block that cannot be earthbent.'
    Extraction:
      Description: This ability allows metalbenders to extract the minerals from ore blocks. To use, simply tap sneak while looking at an ore block with metal in it (iron, gold, quartz) and the ore will be extracted and drop in front of you. This ability has a small chance of doubling or tripling the loot. This ability has a short cooldown.
    LavaFlow:
      Description: 'This ability allows an Earthbender to create lava using the Earth
        around them. To use, simply hold sneak (Default: Shift) to create a lava moat
        that surrounds you, press sneak again to remove the moat. Left click an Earthbendable
        block to create a pool of lava after a small delay. Additionally, you can
        left click at any time to turn lava back into its original state -- Earth.'
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was caught in by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    EarthSmash:
      Description: 'To raise an EarthSmash hold sneak (default: shift) for approximately
        1.5 seconds, then release while aiming at dirt. To grab the EarthSmash aim
        at the center and hold sneak, the EarthSmash will follow your mouse. You can
        shoot the EarthSmash by grabbing onto it and left clicking. To ride the EarthSmash
        simply hop ontop of it and hold sneak while aiming in the direction that you
        wish to go. Another way to ride an EarthSmash is to grab it with sneak and
        then right click it. Use EarthSmash as a defensive shield, a powerful attack,
        or an advanced means of transportation.'
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was crushed by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    MetalClips:
      Description: MetalClips has the potential to be both an offensive and a utility ability. To start, you must carry smelted Iron Ingots in your inventory. To apply the clips onto an entity, simply click at them. If the entity is a Zombie, a Skeleton, or a Player, the clips will form armor around the entity, giving you some control over them. Each additional clip will give you more control. If you have permission to do so, you may crush the entity against a wall with a 4th clip, hurting them. Without explicit permissions, you will only be able to strap three clips on your target. If the entity is not one of the above, the clip will simply do damage and fall to the ground, to be collected. Another permission requiring action is throwing entities. To do so, click while controlling a metalclipped entity
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was too slow for {attacker}''s {ability}'
    RaiseEarth:
      Description: 'To use, simply left-click on an earthbendable block. A column
        of earth will shoot upwards from that location. Anything in the way of the
        column will be brought up with it, leaving talented benders the ability to
        trap brainless entities up there. Additionally, simply sneak (default shift)
        looking at an earthbendable block. A wall of earth will shoot upwards from
        that location. Anything in the way of the wall will be brought up with it. '
    Shockwave:
      Description: 'This is one of the most powerful moves in the earthbender''s arsenal.
        To use, you must first charge it by holding sneak (default: shift). Once charged,
        you can release sneak to create an enormous shockwave of earth, disturbing
        all earth around you and expanding radially outwards. Anything caught in the
        shockwave will be blasted back and dealt damage. If you instead click while
        charged, the disruption is focused in a cone in front of you. Lastly, if you
        fall from a great enough height with this ability selected, you will automatically
        create a shockwave.'

      Description: SandSpout is a core move for travelling, evasion, and mobility for sandbenders. To use, simply left click while over sand or sandstone, and a column of sand will form at your feet, enabling you to levitate. Any mobs or players that touch your column will receive damage and be blinded. Beware, as the spout will stop working when no longer over sand!
    Tremorsense:
      Description: This is a pure utility ability for earthbenders. If you are in an area of low-light and are standing on top of an earthbendable block, this ability will automatically turn that block into glowstone, visible *only by you*. If you lose contact with a bendable block, the light will go out as you have lost contact with the earth and cannot 'see' until you can touch earth again. Additionally, if you click with this ability selected, smoke will appear above nearby earth with pockets of air beneath them.
    Description: Earth is the element of substance. Earthbenders share many of the same fundamental techniques as Waterbenders, but their domain is quite different and more readily accessible. Earthbenders dominate the ground and subterranean, having abilities to pull columns of rock straight up from the earth or drill their way through the mountain. They can also launch themselves through the air using pillars of rock, and will not hurt themselves assuming they land on something they can bend. The more skilled Earthbenders can even bend metal.
  Fire:
    Blaze:
      Description: To use, simply left-click in any direction. An arc of fire will flow from your location, igniting anything in its path. Additionally, tap sneak to engulf the area around you in roaring flames.

    Combustion:
      Description: 'Combustion is a powerful ability only known by a few skilled Firebenders.
        It allows the bender to Firebend with their mind, concentrating energy to
        create a powerful blast. To use, simply tap sneak (Default: Shift) to launch
        the blast. This technique is highly destructive and very effective, it also
        comes with a long cooldown.'
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was shot down by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    FireBlast:
      Description: FireBlast is the most fundamental bending technique of a firebender. To use, simply left-click in a direction. A blast of fire will be created at your fingertips. If this blast contacts an enemy, it will dissipate and engulf them in flames, doing additional damage and knocking them back slightly. If the blast hits terrain, it will ignite the nearby area. Additionally, if you hold sneak, you will charge up the fireblast. If you release it when it's charged, it will instead launch a powerful fireball that explodes on contact.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was burnt by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    FireBurst:
      Description: FireBurst is a very powerful firebending ability. To use, press and hold sneak to charge your burst. Once charged, you can either release sneak to release the burst in a sphere around you or click to launch a cone-shaped burst of flames in front of you.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} was blown apart by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    FireJet:
      Description: This ability is used for a limited burst of flight for firebenders. Clicking with this ability selected will launch you in the direction you're looking, granting you controlled flight for a short time. This ability can be used mid-air to prevent falling to your death, but on the ground it can only be used if standing on a block that's ignitable (e.g. not snow or water).
    FireShield:
      Description: FireShield is a basic defensive ability. Clicking with this ability selected will create a small disc of fire in front of you, which will block most attacks and bending. Alternatively, pressing and holding sneak creates a very small shield of fire, blocking most attacks. Creatures that contact this fire are ignited.
      DeathMessage: '{victim} scorched theirself on {attacker}''s {ability}'
    HeatControl:
      Description: While this ability is selected, the firebender becomes impervious to fire damage and cannot be ignited. If the user left-clicks with this ability, the targeted area will be extinguished, although it will leave any creature burning engulfed in flames. This ability can also cool lava. If this ability is used while targetting ice or snow, it will instead melt blocks in that area. Finally, sneaking with this ability will cook any food in your hand.
    Illumination:
      Description: This ability gives firebenders a means of illuminating the area. It is a toggle - clicking will create a torch that follows you around. The torch will only appear on objects that are ignitable and can hold a torch (e.g. not leaves or ice). If you get too far away from the torch, it will disappear, but will reappear when you get on another ignitable block. Clicking again dismisses this torch.
    Lightning:
      Description: Hold sneak while selecting this ability to charge up a lightning strike. Once charged, release sneak to discharge the lightning to the targeted location.

        DeathMessage: '{victim} was incinerated by {attacker}''s {ability}'
    Description: |-
      Fire is the element of power. Firebenders focus on destruction and incineration. Their abilities are pretty straight forward: set things on fire. They do have a bit of utility however, being able to make themselves un-ignitable, extinguish large areas, cook food in their hands, extinguish large areas, small bursts of flight, and then comes the abilities to shoot fire from your hands.

    Description: |-
      Chiblockers focus on bare handed combat, utilizing their agility and speed to stop any bender right in their path. Although they lack the ability to bend any of the other elements, they are great in combat, and a serious threat to any bender.
